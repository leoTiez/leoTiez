Hi there,

I'm Leo, junior scientist at the CEA in Paris. I work on modelling complex biological systems, among others DNA repair mechanisms and neuronal processing.
I use a lot of Python in my projects, but I've been working with a large palette of different languages, e.g. Java, JavaScript, C++, Solidity, and Julia. Currently,
try to get a bit more native in Julia.

Check out my research projects:
- [modelling the DNA repair pathway](https://github.com/users/leoTiez/projects/1) (all repositories are linked to this project)
- [comparing the primary visual cortex in higher mammals and rodents](https://github.com/leoTiez/Dynamical-consequences-of-long-range-patchy-connections-in-the-neocortex)
- [incorporating a Bayesian inference rule into the Numenta framework](https://github.com/leoTiez/htmresearch)
- [reproduce the results of a recurrent convolutional neural network](https://github.com/leoTiez/dd2424)
