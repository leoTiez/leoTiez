Hi there,

I'm Leo, passionate developer and particularly interested in harnessing biological principles for machine learning & AI. My experience stems from my work on modelling complex biological systems, among others DNA repair mechanisms, cross-species comparison of gene regulation, and neuronal processing.
I use a lot of Python in my projects, but I've been working with a large variety of different languages, among others R, Java, JavaScript, C++, Solidity, and Julia. 

Check out my research projects. The highlights are listed below.
- Repositories related to my PhD:
  -  [The Next-Generation Sequencing-Chess Problem](https://github.com/leoTiez/ngs-chess-conundrum)
  -  [Functional Principal Component Analysis for Nucleosome Data](https://github.com/leoTiez/nucleosome-fpca)  
  -  [A Quantitative Modelling Approach for DNA Repair on a Population Scale](https://github.com/leoTiez/jmak)
- Repositories related to my master's in machine learning:
  - [comparing the primary visual cortex in higher mammals and rodents](https://github.com/leoTiez/Dynamical-consequences-of-long-range-patchy-connections-in-the-neocortex)
  - [incorporating a Bayesian inference rule into the Numenta framework](https://github.com/leoTiez/htmresearch)
  - [reproduce the results of a recurrent convolutional neural network](https://github.com/leoTiez/dd2424)
